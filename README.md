# Real-Time-PPG-Signal-Acquisition
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical technique used to measure blood volume changes in the microvascular tissue. It works by detecting variations in light absorption caused by blood flow, making it useful for monitoring heart rate (BPM), blood oxygen levels (SpOâ‚‚), and other physiological parameters. The PPG signal is the waveform generated by this process, showing periodic changes in blood volume as the heart pumps blood through the body. This signal consists of two main components: the AC component, which represents pulsatile changes due to heartbeats, and the DC component, which represents the baseline signal affected by tissue structure and sensor placement. By analyzing the AC component, heart rate can be determined.

A heartbeat sensor is a device designed to detect the heartbeat and measure heart rate. It operates either through an optical method, like a PPG sensor (e.g., MAX30100 or a pulse sensor), or through an electrical method, such as ECG-based sensors. In this project, the heartbeat sensor follows the optical PPG principle. The sensor consists of an infrared LED that emits light onto the skin, usually at the fingertip or earlobe, and a photodiode that detects the amount of light reflected or transmitted through the tissue. As blood absorbs light differently based on its volume, the changes in reflected light create variations in the received signal. These fluctuations generate a PPG waveform, which is then processed to determine heart rate
